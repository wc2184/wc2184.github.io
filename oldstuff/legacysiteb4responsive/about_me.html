          My name is William Chan. I am a 19 years old freshman attending NYU in
          Steinhardt, majoring in Education Studies. I was born on March 2nd,
          2002 in Brooklyn, New York, United States. I am of Chinese ethnicity,
          as both my parents were from China (Guangdong). I am proud of both my
          American nationality and Chinese heritage and love being a
          Chinese-American here in the United States.

          This is my home residence city, New York City, pictured above. It's
          where I've lived my whole life and is also where NYU is located. I
          went to primary school (P.S.1) here as well as middle school (I.S.
          187) and also high school (M475). I rarely leave this city!

          I enjoy running, although I haven't ran too much lately in 2021 or
          2020 due to laziness. I run outside but a treadmill tends to be better
          on my knees.

          I like music and all forms of related auditory arts. I ocassionally
          play the piano and like singing, although I'm not very good at these
          activities.

          I enjoy learning about the human mind, specifically the science of
          thinking. I try to meditate (with little success) and one of my
          passions is attempting to decipher and understand the causes of
          emotions and poor mental health.
