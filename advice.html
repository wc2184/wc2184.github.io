      <p style="font-size: 12px; position: fixed; top: 40px; left: 50px;">Very Important info</p>
      <p style="position: fixed; bottom: 5px; left: 5px; background-color: lightskyblue; margin: 4px; padding: 4px; border-radius: 5px;">Stop fucking thinking.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: 600; color: mediumpurple;" class="quote">“If a problem is fixable, if a situation is such that you can do something about it, then there is no need to worry. If it's not fixable, then there is no help in worrying. <strong style="text-decoration: underline; color:mediumorchid; font-weight:bolder;">There is no benefit in worrying whatsoever.</strong>” <br>- H.H. Dalai Lama</p>
      <p>
        Perfection is cancer, just fucking wing it. <p class="except">
            (A C+ is literally better
            than whatever fuck extreme procrastination/overworrying/nearly failing bullshit you
            do.)
        </p>
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bolder; color: firebrick;">
        Act immediately - Don't even allow 1 second of worry or analysis or
        planning.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bolder; color: lightseagreen;">
        Start sloppy & Find what's the next, smallest, actionable step, and just
        do that, right now. <p class="except" style=" font-weight: bolder; color: lightseagreen">e.g. This essay is so hard... Okay. I'm focused on writing the first sentence. Just the first sentence. Can't fail here.</p>
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Be present, stop thinking about the future or past. <p class="except">Oh? That kid bullied you at age 10 - oh you need a hug my sweet young boy - <strong>Shut the fuck up lol -</strong> no one's here to save you.</p>
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-weight: bolder; color: firebrick;">Make a designated/scheduled worrying time. So you don't worry now, it's not time yet. Contract all the pain into just 1 hour a day, instead of worrying 24/7.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bolder; color: firebrick;" class="except">(CBT Technique)</p>
      <p style=" font-weight: bolder;color: lightseagreen">Take the steps to do what you should do. After that, <strong>overthinking or worrying is akin to retardation</strong>, like suffering hundreds of times again and again over one thing unnecessarily.</p>
      <p>You can worry, and try to do work while suffering- or you can worry less, and do work while minimizing your suffering. <strong>Nothing changes about your uncontrollable external circumstances</strong> in either choice.</p>
      <p>"Shhh.." your mind in every moment... when walking, when using PC, when in class, even when laying in bed reading emails...</p>
      <p class="quote">There is a force within you that tries to stop you from taking action when it doesn't 'feel right, right now'. <strong>And you have to ACTIVELY ignore it.</strong>  <br> - Enlightened Reddit User 
      </p>
      <p>WIP Below</p>
      <p>Be unreasonable, unrealistic and seemingly full blown stupid and obssesed- <p class="except">Still try and do idiotic things like stay up 72hrs to learn BASIC- even if people think it's stupid.</p> </p>

      <p style="font-weight: bolder; color: firebrick;">So say it. So do it. You want to indulge in that cancerous action? So do it. Just do it then- since you want to so badly.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bolder;color: lightseagreen">The default assumption that "this is of importance" is why you suffer. Literally no one cares what you do or who you even are. Especially walking fucking outside.</p>
      <p class="quote">"Fuck you brain/mind/rational part, come and kill me, but you're not gonna control me. I'm focusing on doing a task, and solely doing a task, and you're gonna fuck off since you're wasting my life. <strong>Come and kill me</strong> if you want to stop me." <br> - Kanye West</p>
      <p>When feeling tired/non-energetic: Tell your brain, energy level gauge, body, blood sugar, hormones to go fuck itself. I'm still going to do work and you're gonna be my bitch and won't dictate what I should do. I eventually will dictate you and not the other way around.</p>
      <p>Just be tired. Instead of hating yourself for being tired- just be tired.</p>
      <p style="font-size: large; text-decoration: underline;">Last one - no amount of 'google searches' or 'productivity advice' or 'self-help' books will change your life. <strong>You just have to do it </strong>and stop wasting time & expecting a book to solve your issues.</p>
