      <p style="font-weight: 600; color: mediumpurple;" class="quote">‚ÄúIf a problem is fixable, if a situation is such that you can do something about it, then there is no need to worry. If it's not fixable, then there is no help in worrying. <strong style="text-decoration: underline; color:mediumorchid; font-weight:bolder;">There is no benefit in worrying whatsoever.</strong>‚Äù <br>- H.H. Dalai Lama</p>
      <p>
        Perfection is cancer, just fucking wing it. <p class="except">
            (A C+ is literally better
            than whatever fuck extreme procrastination/overworrying/nearly failing bullshit you
            do.)
        </p>
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bolder; color: firebrick;">
        Act immediately - Don't even allow 1 second of worry or analysis or
        planning.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bolder; color: lightseagreen;">
        Start sloppy & Find what's the next, smallest, actionable step, and just
        do that, right now. <p class="except" style=" font-weight: bolder; color: lightseagreen">e.g. This essay is so hard... Okay. I'm focused on writing the first sentence. Just the first sentence. Can't fail here.</p>
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Be present, stop thinking about the future or past. <p class="except">Oh? That kid bullied you at age 10 - oh you need a hug my sweet young boy - <strong>Shut the fuck up lol -</strong> no one's here to save you.</p>
      </p>
      <p>Nothing you've ever done makes you a bad person. You were the product of your environment. Be vulnerable. You are inherently worth it as a human being no matter what you think or do. </p>
      
      <p style="font-weight: bolder; color: firebrick;">Make a designated/scheduled worrying time. So you don't worry now, it's not time yet. Contract all the pain into just 1 hour a day, instead of worrying 24/7.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bolder; color: firebrick;" class="except">(CBT Technique)</p>
      <p style=" font-weight: bolder;color: lightseagreen">Take the steps to do what you should do. After that, <strong>overthinking or worrying is akin to retardation</strong>, like suffering hundreds of times again and again over one thing unnecessarily.</p>
      <p>You can worry, and try to do work while suffering- or you can worry less, and do work while minimizing your suffering. <strong>Nothing changes about your uncontrollable external circumstances</strong> in either choice.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 32px; color: rebeccapurple;"><strong>Work like fucking hell. 10+ hours a day. 7 days a week. üí™</strong>  <br>
      </p>
      <p>"Shhh.." your mind in every moment... when walking, when using PC, when in class, even when laying in bed reading emails... Just "Shhh.." - yeah, it feels good to not have a noisy brain.</p>
      <p class="quote">There is a force within you that tries to stop you from taking action when it doesn't 'feel right, right now'. <strong>And you have to ACTIVELY ignore it.</strong>  <br> - Enlightened Reddit User 
      </p>
     <p class="quote">The problem is not thoughts themselves but the state of thinking without knowing that we are thinking. <br> - Sam Harris</p>
      
      <p>Be unreasonable, unrealistic and seemingly full blown stupid and obssesed- <p class="except">Still try and do idiotic things like stay up 72hrs to learn BASIC- even if people think it's stupid.</p> </p>

      <p style="font-weight: bolder; color: firebrick;">So say it. So do it. You want to indulge in that cancerous action? So do it. Just do it then- since you want to so badly.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bolder;color: lightseagreen">The default assumption that "this is of importance" is why you suffer. Literally no one cares what you do or who you even are. Especially walking fucking outside.</p>
      <p class="quote">"Fuck you brain/mind/rational part, come and kill me, but you're not gonna control me. I'm focusing on doing a task, and solely doing a task, and you're gonna fuck off since you're wasting my life. <strong>Come and kill me</strong> if you want to stop me." <br> - Kanye West</p>
      <p>When feeling tired/non-energetic: Tell your brain, energy level gauge, body, blood sugar, hormones to go fuck itself. I'm still going to do work and you're gonna be my bitch and won't dictate what I should do. I eventually will dictate you and not the other way around.</p>
      <p>Just be tired. Instead of hating yourself for being tired and unproductive today, just be tired.</p>
      
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pick your one overwhelming desire ‚Äì it‚Äôs okay to suffer over that one. <br><br>The universe is rigged in such a way that if you just want one thing, and you focus on that, you‚Äôll get it, but everything else you gotta let go.</p>&mdash; Erik Torenberg (@eriktorenberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1233598164470419457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 29, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
      
      <p style="font-weight: bolder; color: firebrick; font-size: large; text-decoration: underline;">Lastly - no amount of 'google searches' or 'productivity advice' or 'self-help' books will change your life. <strong>You just have to do it </strong>and stop wasting time & expecting a book to solve your issues. <br> Miracles don't happen, hard work happens.</p>
