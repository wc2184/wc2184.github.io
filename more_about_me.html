        <h2>Powdered Food Experiment</h2>
        <p>
          One of the biggest causes of overeating is boredom and the desire to
          feel good for a short time. During the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, most
          people were quarantining from society for many months in a row. So,
          naturally, people would want to eat more and thus many people gained
          weight! I gained 30 lbs (13.6 kgs) last year! So, I wanted to go on a
          diet.
        </p>
        <p>
          But one of the main issues of trying to diet was that people did not
          have accurate calorie counters. My mom's homecooked chinese dinners
          would have anywhere from 1000 calories to 2000 calories but I wouldn't
          know how much, because it is homecooked.

          What is Soylent? <br />
          Well, Soylent is simply a complete powdered food. "Complete" means
          that this powder has all the nutrients you need to survive, and you
          just need to consume this one food and all your calories, vitamins,
          minerals, sodium, etc... will be fulfilled. It is a powder you mix
          with water in a shaker bottle that becomes liquid food. Takes 30
          seconds to make.
          <br />
          <br />
          Here are the nutrition facts and calories:

          The best part is, you are in complete control of the calories in your
          diet now. Each serving is 400 calories, so you will know how much
          calories you are eating exactly. This food is extremely satiating and
          I don't feel hungry after drinking this. I drink 4 servings a day and
          am starting to lose weight! You aren't supposed to eat anything else.
          Dropped 5 lbs (2.2 kg) in a month! Very good news, maybe you readers
          should try this out! Click <a href="https://soylent.com/">here</a> to
          buy Soylent!

          Disney World is the paradise of many kid's dreams. It is a
          entertainment resort that has rides, restuarants, swimming pools,
          costumed childhood characters, and so much more. I was fortunate my
          parents could afford to let me visit Disney when I was 10 years old. I
          spent a week and visited the 4 parks of Disney which included the
          Animal Kingdom which had elephants, giraffes, lions, pumas, and much
          more. I loved seeing these animals as a kid and won't ever forget
          these memories.

          Overall, the trip was so fun and I want to back as an adult. There's
          something magical about seeing animals outside of a zoo, as the Animal
          Kingdom is more of a safari-type exhibition. I never knew giraffes
          were so tall! Maybe I'll go back after the Covid-19 pandemic is over
          and Disney starts reopening in full! I highly suggest checking out
          Disney World's website, just click
